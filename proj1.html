  <h3>Project Overview</h3>
  <p>During the course of CPRE 288 we were tasked with the design of a remote-controlled iRobot. Over the course of the semester we built various parts of the code for controlling this robot. At the end of the year we combined all of the parts previously worked on in an attempt to create a fully functional robot controlled by a user through an interface. At the finish of the course we navigated through an obstacle course to find a point in which the robot was “safe”. This course included cliffs, an outline to stay within and several pillars that were to be avoided.</p>

  <h3>My Role</h3>
  <p>Developed various parts of irobot controls including: <br> WiFi Connectivity <br> Movement Controls <br> Sensor Gathering Algorithms </p>

  <h3>Skills Learned</h3>
  <p>Application of Mathmatics for Movement <br> Low Level Circuit Integration <br> Gather and Interpreting Sensor Data </p>

  <h3>Resources Used</h3>
  <p>C++ <br> integrated circuits <br> wifi chips <br> motor controls <br> irobot</p>
